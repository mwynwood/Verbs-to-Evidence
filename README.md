# Verbs to Evidence
This table provides a guide as to which **Assessment and Evidence Gathering Techniques** might be suited to a particular **Performance Criteria** in a Unit of Competence.

Units in [National Training Packages](https://training.gov.au/Search/Training?SearchTitleOrCode=&IncludeSupersededData=false&TypeAllTrainingComponents=false&TypeTrainingPackages=true&TypeTrainingPackages=false&TypeQualifications=false&TypeAccreditedCourses=false&TypeModule=false&TypeUnitsOfCompetency=false&TypeUnitContextualisations=false&TypeSkillSets=false&nrtSearchSubmit=Search&AdvancedSearch=False&JavaScriptEnabled=true&educationLevel=-99&TaxonomyOccupation=&TaxonomyIndustrySector=&recognisedby=-99) contain a number of *verbs* in the Performance Criteria. These verbs can give you clues on to what type of evidence to collect, and a direction on how you might assess. Make sure you take into account the **Foundation Skills** of the unit.

If anyone would like to help me with creating this table, please get in touch: [https://twitter.com/MarcusTeachUs](https://twitter.com/MarcusTeachUs)

Common **verbs** are listed down the left hand column.

**Assessment and Evidence Gathering Techniques** are listed across the top.
